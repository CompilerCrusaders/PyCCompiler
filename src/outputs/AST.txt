Function: (int) main 
  Variable: (int) a (operator) = (int) 5 (operator) + (int) 7
  Variable: (int) b (operator) = (int) 6
  Assignment: (int) b (operator) = (int) b (operator) - (int) 1
  Variable: (int) c (operator) = (int) a (operator) + (int) b (operator) + (int) 4 (operator) + (int) 2
  Variable: (int) d (operator) = (int) a (operator) * (int) b
  Assignment: (int) c (operator) = (int) c (operator) + (int) 1
  Variable: (char) symbol1 (operator) = (char) 'x'
  Return: (int) 0
