#take the tokens from the lexer and analyze!  
#find and make a list of syntax rules for c
#do the tokens match the syntax rules?
#Figure out what BNF or Backus-Naur Form is and how to use it
#Figure out how to use the tokens to make an AST

import lexer as lex

cFile = "src/test/processedc.txt"

tokens = lex.run(cFile) #this will ultimately or temporarily be where we run the lexer code... thats why I put this
